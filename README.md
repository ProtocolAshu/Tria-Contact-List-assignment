## Features

-   **View Contacts:** Displays a list of contacts with their name, email, and phone number.
-   **Search Contacts:** Allows searching contacts by name using a search bar. The list updates in real-time as you type.
-   **Add New Contact (Optional):** Provides a form to add new contacts to the list. (Implemented)

## Technical Stack

-   **Framework:** React (using Vite for bundling)
-   **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
-   **API Interaction:** Mimics an asynchronous API call using JavaScript `Promise` and `setTimeout` for fetching and adding contacts. Data is hardcoded in `src/api/contacts.js`.
-   **Styling:** Pure CSS (module-based for components).
